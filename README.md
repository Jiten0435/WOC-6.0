A Graphical Password Authentication system is an authentication system that uses some combination of graphical images replacing the regular passwords. It prevents many types of password hacking methods which is used to crack regular alphanumeric passwords, making it more secure than traditional authentication method.

In this project, I have created a system in which user have to sign-up to the system using their email and select the images in a specific pattern to create the account and password successfuly.
After that user can Sign-in to the system using their credentials. If user enters wrong credentials for more than 4 times then their account is removed from the system.

To make this system, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript as techstacks.
